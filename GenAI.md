Generative AI (GenAI) is a type of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data.

* The importance of generative AI:

  * Generative AI is a revolutionary technology comparable to the invention of photography, enabling the creation of content without artistic talent.
  * It can generate text, design products, produce music and create visual effects using algorithms trained on existing data.
  * Generative AI reduces the burden of repetitive tasks, allowing humans to focus on more creative and strategic activities.
 
* How generative AI is different than other types of AI

  * Generative AI: Focuses on generating new content, such as images, videos, text, and music.
  * Other Types of AI: For example - discriminative AI, which classifies or identifies content based on preexisting data.
  * Broader AI Landscape: Generative AI is one of several subcategories of AI, each designed for different tasks, such as reactive machines for self-driving cars and
                          limited memory AI for weather forecasting.

* How generative AI works

  * Training AI: Generative AI is trained by feeding it vast amounts of data and teaching algorithms to generate outputs.
  * Different Models: There are various generative AI models, created by experts and funded by companies and universities.
  * User Levels: Different users can interact with generative AI models based on their technical expertise:
    * Business Leaders: Use open-source models or partner with corporations.
    * Creative Technologists: Pick pre-made models from repositories like GitHub.
    * Non-Technical Users: Use ready-made applications like ChatGPT or Midjourney.
   
* Creating our own contents:

  * Beginner Options: Use paid services like Midjourney or Lensa to create content easily.
  * Advanced Users: Utilize notebooks from platforms like GitHub to customize and run generative AI models.
  * Google Colab: A popular tool for running notebooks, offering personalized settings and requiring a subscription for faster processing.
  * Summary:
    * A **model** is a set of algorithms that have been trained on a specific dataset.
    * A **notebook** is a tool for writing and running the code.
    * A **creative application** is an example of how a model can be used.
    * The **generated outcome** is what the end user produces by using a generative AI service or a notebook that houses the model inside it.
   
* Evolution of LLMs: The transition from standalone LLMs like ChatGPT to dynamic LLM APIs, including the latest GPT-4o, which supports real-time conversations and multimodal interactions.
* API Functionality: APIs act as intermediaries, allowing developers to integrate LLM capabilities into their applications without needing to understand the complex backend processes.
* Real-World Applications: Companies like Stripe, Zapier, Jasper, Duolingo and Shopify use GPT APIs to enhance their services.
* Caution: While LLMs offer impressive capabilities, it's crucial to remember that they are tools trained on finite datasets and should not be seen as ultimate sources of truth.

* Wider adoption of generative AI:

  * Accessibility: Generative AI models can now run on mobile devices, making advanced AI tools more accessible to the general public.
  * Cloud-Based Solutions: Major tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon have integrated AI capabilities into their cloud platforms, facilitating easier adoption for businesses.
  * Democratization of Creativity: The availability of generative AI tools on mobile and cloud platforms has revolutionized creative industries, allowing more people to engage in creative processes.
  * Positive Outlook: The widespread adoption of AI has shifted public sentiment towards a more positive view, highlighting its tangible benefits in productivity and creativity.

* GenAI Models:

  * Natural Language Model:
    *  GPT Model: GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a language model developed by OpenAI, known for generating human-like text.
    *  Applications: Examples include GitHub Copilot for code suggestions and Microsoft's Bing for enhanced search functionality.
    *  Popularity: ChatGPT reached 1 million users in just one week, showcasing its rapid adoption.
    *  Limitations: GPT has limitations such as lack of common sense, creativity, and understanding of the text it generates, and it can be prone to biases. 

  * Text to Image applications:
    * Main Tools: The three primary text-to-image generation services are Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion, each with unique characteristics and approaches.
    * Industrial Applications: Examples include Cuebric for film backgrounds, Stitch Fix for fashion recommendations, and various marketing campaigns using generative AI for creative processes.
    * Benefits: Generative AI in text-to-image applications offers time and cost-saving efficiencies and provides a unique look and feel to the generated content.
   
  * Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):
    * Functionality: GANs consist of two parts: the Generator, which creates data, and the Discriminator, which evaluates it.
                     They work together in a competitive process to improve the quality of the generated data.
    * Applications: GANs are used in various fields, such as designing wheels for Audi, creating visual effects for films, and generating synthetic data for financial fraud detection.
    * Versatility: The same GAN model can be applied to diverse tasks, from creative design to financial security, showcasing its adaptability and broad utility.
    * Example: Imagine you have an artist called The Generator who is trying to recreate a painting that is so realistic that it looks like a famous painting.
      And you have another person called The Discriminator who's an art expert and trying to spot the difference between the real painting and the forgery.
      The Generator creates a painting and The Discriminator evaluates it, giving feedback to the generator on how to improve the next iteration.
      The Generator and The Discriminator played this game repeatedly until The Generator creates the painting that is so realistic that The Discriminator can't tell the difference
      between it and the real painting. In the same way, a GAN model has a generator and a discriminator. The two parts work together in a competition.
      That's why it's called generative adversarial networks. In this way, they improve the generator's ability to create realistic data, and over time, t
      he generator becomes better and better at creating realistic data. And the results start yielding in the creation of products, assets, faces, people, that didn't exist before,
      just like we have seen with text-to-image that we have seen in the former session. The difference though is that with GANs, you input one type of data,
      like pictures or bank transitions and then you output the same type of data.

  * VAE and Anomaly Detection:
    * Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): VAEs are used for anomaly detection by training on normal data and identifying instances that deviate from this norm.
    * Applications: VAEs are used in various fields, such as detecting fraud in financial transactions, spotting flaws in manufacturing, identifying security breaches in networks and
      finding anomalies in medical imaging.
    * Real-World Examples: Companies like Uber and Google use VAEs for tasks like fraud detection and network intrusion detection, while healthcare providers use them to predict patient risks.
